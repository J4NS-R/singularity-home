        It hosts backend apps, services, cron scripts, certificate management, game servers, and much more
        for his applications, platforms, and personal use.</p>

    <p>Singularity was named after the currently-hypothesised point in time at which
        the intelligence of machines will surpass that of mankind (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">wiki</a>).
        Being one of the greatest philosophical
        issues in computer science, George deemed it a very apt name.
